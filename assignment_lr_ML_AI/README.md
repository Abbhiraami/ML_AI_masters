### Upgrad - Linear Regression Assigmnent

Solving a bike sharing company data to identify the potential drivers for attracting more customers

Business Goal:
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
