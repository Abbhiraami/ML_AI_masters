    "### **Project Semantic spotter**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application name**: **Insure Assist AI**\n",
    "\n",
    "This application has two important use cases:\n",
    "- Comparison across multiple policies: Helps insurance agents/ advisors, product teams and customers choosing between plans \n",
    "- Granular benefit and claim related explanations: Helps in assisting cliam handlers and policyholders for more comphresenive way to understand the policy clauses and benefits without going through lengthy documents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Document Extraction → Smart Chunking + Metadata → Embedding → VectorDB → User Query → Retrieval (hybrid) → Rerank → LLM Response (Comparison/Q&A)**\n",
    "#### **Core Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "“What is the death benefit under Sampoorna Jeevan vs. Poorna Suraksha?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Which of the three policies cover critical illness extensively?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What is the waiting period for claim eligibility in Easy Health?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Compare surrender benefits across policies.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Tech Stack**\n",
    "\n",
    "**LlamaIndex** - LlamaIndex is an open-source framework that excels at the \"retrieval\" and \"augmentation\" parts of RAG. It is particularly well-suited for my use case for several key reasons:\n",
    "- Data-Centric Design\n",
    "- Advanced data connectors and parsers\n",
    "- Sophisticated Indexing and retreival strategies - Mainly focusing on metadata filtering as simple semantic search is not enough for the policies information provided for this problem statemnet. LlamaIndex makes it straightforward to add metadata (e.g., policy_name, policy_type: 'group', UIN: '101N137V02') to each chunk of text. This allows the system to first filter for only the relevant documents (all group policies) before performing the semantic search, leading to far more accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, it is Llama-Index is purposefully built for RAG system. It is well-suited for ingesting and indexing complex documents like policies."

    "- The major challenges were to pick the right chunking strategy and LLM model for response generation. GPT-3,5-turbo is the cheapest in terms of cost and credits efficiency. However, it was neither a good semantic extractor nor a response generator. GPT-4o-mini was doing a better job with massive exhaustion of credit limit. So, generated the responses for some questions to stay on budget.\n",
