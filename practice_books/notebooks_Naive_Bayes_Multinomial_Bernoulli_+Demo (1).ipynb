      " ' steven spielberg s   amistad     which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship   then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who   owned   them   is concerned with several different aspects of this story    first   the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery    second   it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case   including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams   anthony hopkins      last   and most importantly   it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade       amistad   succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements    i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another   anti slavery   movie    having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery   i doubted that there was much i didn t already know about it    fortunately   i turned out to be wrong    for one thing   spielberg s camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders  operations in africa   so   amistad   was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning    and some of the images here are   in fact   much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery    one scene in the middle   in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their   excess   slaves by throwing them overboard to drown   has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year    spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would   and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc 17 rating    the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians   such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain   whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time    exposing politicians as narrow minded   opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff   of course   but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation    the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time   such that john quincy adams   and probably other politicians like him     who clearly disapproved of the practice   was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court    the biggest success of   amistad   is probably the characterization of cinque   djimon hounsou     who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin   matthew mcconaughey     the lawyer who represents them in court    through cinque   we are given a window into the native culture   as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member   or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ    cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that   again   contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles       what kind of country is this   where laws  almost  work     he asks baldwin in bewilderment   when he learns that the case must be re tried before the supreme court    spielberg s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times   such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque s angry outburst in the court room    still   there isn t enough of this for it to be a serious problem    the main flaw in this film   which prevents it from earning four stars   is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can t quite handle all of these issues at the same time   so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie    this summer s contact   for example   dealt with several issues at once   but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and   most importantly   all of them were resolved at once       amistad   tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams   but it somehow feels a little forced   and in any case the speech itself   which lasts almost fifteen minutes   wears out its welcome about halfway through    perhaps the best way to describe it is this     amistad   is three four star films edited into one    almost every individual scene works   but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence   and thus is less than the sum of its parts    however   i can t honestly say how it could have been done differently   and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film   and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery    '\n",

      " ' the kids in the hall are an acquired taste    it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer    maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies   they would grow into the big screen    my recommendation is that   unless you are a big fan of the kids   skip the film    as it is   their first  and most likely only  attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv    a big budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show    the kids go through the motions   but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so    and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics    brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression    in typical sketch comedy tradition   each actor plays several roles    doctor cooper   kevin mcdonald   and his team create the drug    then   under pressure from don roritor   mark mckinney     founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals   dr   cooper releases the drug into the marketplace    the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film    at about 90 minutes   brain candy still seems long    the best thing about sketch comedy  and the kids are no exception  is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs   then go on to another quick skit    but with the additional set up necessary in telling a longer   coherent story   the laughs just dont come fast enough    strangely   the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv    the movie makes several attempts at risqueness  mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters  but they seem almost forced   as if they have to live up to a pg rating    one of the best bits   though   does make use of thompsons naked buttocks   we see him charging into battle  going to have sex with some guys taking a shower    in the classic of this genre   monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail    the kids   unfortunately   are not up to the task    there are some amusing moments   to be sure   but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one    '\n",
      " ' there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director    of course   his best film was 1978 s masterpiece     halloween     but he also made 1980 s   the fog     and 1987 s underrated     prince of darkness      heck   he even made a good film in 1995   with   in the mouth of madness      but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992   with the terrible comedy     memoirs of an invisible man      somehow   carpenter has lost his touch   with junk like his failed 1995 remake of     village of the damned     to his uninspired 1996 sequel     escape from l   a     those movies   however   look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film     john carpenter s vampires      if i was him   i definately wouldn t want to put my own name in the title    it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as     vampires      the story is simple    jack crow   james woods   is a vampire hunter who   along with one of his partners   montoya   daniel baldwin     and a prostitute   katrina   sheryl lee     survives an attack from the master vampire   valek   thomas ian griffith      since katrina was previously bitten by him   crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later   and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her    it seems valek s mission is to steal a black   wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him    my question is   how many time have we seen this same story played out    well   the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made       john carpenter s vampires     sadly enough   is one of the most unscary horror films i ve ever seen    in fact   there isn t even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105 minute running time    the non stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed   without any interesting camera work   which is usually a trademark of carpenter s    and then we come to the screenplay   which   as far as i can tell   is nearly non existent    there is no story development   and there isn t even an attempt to flesh out the characters    james woods can be a good actor   but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of   pseudo    clever lines of dialogue    daniel baldwin has some potential   but his character comes off as being very dense    and sheryl lee   faring much better as laura palmer in   twin peaks       like all of the female characters   plays an offensive stereotypical whore    there is not an ounce of intelligence   or excitement in     john carpenter s vamires     which is very disheartening coming from an ex fan of carpenter s    he has said that he turned down directing     halloween   h20     because he couldn t work up any excitement for it    and yet   when asked about a   vampires   sequel   he said he would be happy to do it    i think that s a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent   not to mention a significant number of iq points    '\n",

       "       ' steven spielberg s   amistad     which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship   then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who   owned   them   is concerned with several different aspects of this story    first   the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery    second   it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case   including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams   anthony hopkins      last   and most importantly   it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade       amistad   succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements    i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another   anti slavery   movie    having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery   i doubted that there was much i didn t already know about it    fortunately   i turned out to be wrong    for one thing   spielberg s camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders  operations in africa   so   amistad   was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning    and some of the images here are   in fact   much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery    one scene in the middle   in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their   excess   slaves by throwing them overboard to drown   has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year    spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would   and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc 17 rating    the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians   such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain   whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time    exposing politicians as narrow minded   opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff   of course   but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation    the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time   such that john quincy adams   and probably other politicians like him     who clearly disapproved of the practice   was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court    the biggest success of   amistad   is probably the characterization of cinque   djimon hounsou     who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin   matthew mcconaughey     the lawyer who represents them in court    through cinque   we are given a window into the native culture   as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member   or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ    cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that   again   contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles       what kind of country is this   where laws  almost  work     he asks baldwin in bewilderment   when he learns that the case must be re tried before the supreme court    spielberg s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times   such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque s angry outburst in the court room    still   there isn t enough of this for it to be a serious problem    the main flaw in this film   which prevents it from earning four stars   is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can t quite handle all of these issues at the same time   so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie    this summer s contact   for example   dealt with several issues at once   but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and   most importantly   all of them were resolved at once       amistad   tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams   but it somehow feels a little forced   and in any case the speech itself   which lasts almost fifteen minutes   wears out its welcome about halfway through    perhaps the best way to describe it is this     amistad   is three four star films edited into one    almost every individual scene works   but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence   and thus is less than the sum of its parts    however   i can t honestly say how it could have been done differently   and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film   and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery    ',\n",

       "       ' there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director    of course   his best film was 1978 s masterpiece     halloween     but he also made 1980 s   the fog     and 1987 s underrated     prince of darkness      heck   he even made a good film in 1995   with   in the mouth of madness      but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992   with the terrible comedy     memoirs of an invisible man      somehow   carpenter has lost his touch   with junk like his failed 1995 remake of     village of the damned     to his uninspired 1996 sequel     escape from l   a     those movies   however   look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film     john carpenter s vampires      if i was him   i definately wouldn t want to put my own name in the title    it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as     vampires      the story is simple    jack crow   james woods   is a vampire hunter who   along with one of his partners   montoya   daniel baldwin     and a prostitute   katrina   sheryl lee     survives an attack from the master vampire   valek   thomas ian griffith      since katrina was previously bitten by him   crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later   and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her    it seems valek s mission is to steal a black   wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him    my question is   how many time have we seen this same story played out    well   the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made       john carpenter s vampires     sadly enough   is one of the most unscary horror films i ve ever seen    in fact   there isn t even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105 minute running time    the non stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed   without any interesting camera work   which is usually a trademark of carpenter s    and then we come to the screenplay   which   as far as i can tell   is nearly non existent    there is no story development   and there isn t even an attempt to flesh out the characters    james woods can be a good actor   but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of   pseudo    clever lines of dialogue    daniel baldwin has some potential   but his character comes off as being very dense    and sheryl lee   faring much better as laura palmer in   twin peaks       like all of the female characters   plays an offensive stereotypical whore    there is not an ounce of intelligence   or excitement in     john carpenter s vamires     which is very disheartening coming from an ex fan of carpenter s    he has said that he turned down directing     halloween   h20     because he couldn t work up any excitement for it    and yet   when asked about a   vampires   sequel   he said he would be happy to do it    i think that s a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent   not to mention a significant number of iq points    ',\n",
